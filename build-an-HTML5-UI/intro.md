Welcome!

You're about to spin up a brand new React app, and then make some fun changes to it!

The code you will be working with is running in the Cloud ☁️.

In the bottom-right panel you can see we are installing some dependencies we need to build the app.

This can take a few minutes, but whilst it's doing that, click on the the `START` button below to begin!
