# Orientation

Whilst the depenendencies are downloading (it really does take ages with Killercoda), let's get familiar with our surroundings.


## Dependencies
We are starting a fresh development environment with all the dependencies installed:
- Ubuntu Linux
- npm
- Node.js
- React
- Chakra UI


## Killercoda Orientation

  - Scenario instructions
- Right side:
  - Code editor
      - File navigator
      - File editor
      - Terminal window


## Development server
Once all the dependencies have been installed, the terminal window should show the following message:
```
webpack compiled successfully
```
The application is now available at: {{TRAFFIC_HOST1_3000}}/

This tutorial contains source code for a React app that will display a list of cats on the **Cats4Life** web site.

In the terminal type the commands you're given as you go through the steps. 
You can also just click the *black areas* and the corresponding commands will be run in the Terminal window for you.
