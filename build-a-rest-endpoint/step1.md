Before we begin:

    1. Install the JSON Viewer plugin for Chrome

This makes it easier to read the results of calling a REST API.

Go to: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/JSON%20Viewer
and then click the top resulting JSON Viewer extension, from *tulios*. Then click "Add to Chrome" to install it.



    2. Have a look at a publically available API for getting pictures of cats

Go to: https://api.thecatapi.com/v1/images/search

* If you click the URL in the returned JSON response it will open a picture of a cat in a new tab in your browser.
* Every time you make a request to this API, it will return details of another, randomly selected cat.


    3. Or, if you prefer dogs:

Go to: https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random

* Every time you make a request to this API, it will return details of another, randomly selected dog.
